# Computer Engineering - UNAM

I'm student of Computer Engineering at UNAM.
The goal of this repo is to explain the concepts of programming in Python, Java, C++, and C
and the concepts of Data Structures, Algorithms and Oriented Object Programming.

I want to share my knowledge of my previous semesters with you.
In this repository you can find my notes and projects.

On internet you can find a lot of tutorials and books, but I think that it is important to
have a good understanding of the concepts of programming and to be able to apply them in your
projects.
