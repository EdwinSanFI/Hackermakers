👨‍💻 I'm Edwin and I'm a student of Computer Engineering at UNAM.
The goal of this repo is to explain the concepts of programming in Python, Java, C++ and C,
and the concepts of Data Structures, Algorithms and Oriented Object Programming.

I want to share my knowledge of my previous semesters with you.
In this repository you can find my notes and projects.

On internet you can find a lot of tutorials and books but sometimes they are difficult to understand and I think that it is important to
have a good understanding of the concepts of programming and to be able to apply them in your projects.
